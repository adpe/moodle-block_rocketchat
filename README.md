# Moodle Rocket.Chat Block Plugin ![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/adpe/moodle-block_rocketchat/workflows/Moodle%20Plugin%20CI/badge.svg)

The Rocket.Chat block plugin acts as overview and quick access between Moodle and Rocket.Chat. This block lists all groups and channels of the Rocket.Chat user.

## Main features

1. Channel overview (public and private)
2. Access to Rocket.Chat channels and groups.

## Installation

This plugin has a dependency as the [`local_rocketchat`](https://github.com/adpe/moodle-local_rocketchat) plugin must be installed first. After that please do these steps:

1. Copy this Rocket.Chat plugin to the `blocks` directory of your Moodle instance: `git clone https://github.com/adpe/moodle-blocks_rocketchat.git blocks/rocketchat`
2. Run `composer install` inside the `blocks/rocketchat` directory to install the dependencies
3. Visit the notifications' page to complete the installation process

For more information, visit [documentation](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_contributed_modules_or_plugins) for installing contributed modules and plugins.

*Note* - you need a running Rocket.Chat server that you can point the plugin to. If you aren't sure how to do this, checkout
the [documentation](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/) on Rocket.Chat.

## Configuration
